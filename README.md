# StratigraphicMM

StratigraphicMM is a MATLAB toolbox that can be used for the Markov chain simulation for the sedimentary facies analysis. The initial results of the simulation and modeling look very promising and have been tested. 

The current repository consists of transition probability matrices, stationary distribution analysis, transitional diagram, Markov model chain computation, and simulation. 

Only one add-on dependency for the scientific colour visualization:
