# StratigraphicMM

StratigraphicMM is a MATLAB toolbox that can be used for the Markov chain simulation for the sedimentary facies analysis. The code snippets described here are currently in the development process. The initial results of the simulation and modeling look very promising which have been tested with the published datasets. 

The current repository consists of transition probability matrices, stationary distribution analysis, transitional diagram, Markov model chain computation, and simulation. 

Only one add-on dependency for the scientific colour visualization:
